#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing inventory management, reducing waste, and enhancing customer satisfaction in manufacturing and distribution. Improving the accuracy of these forecasts through machine learning can lead to cost savings, better resource allocation, and more efficient production planning.

#### Research Question
"How can machine learning models improve the accuracy of demand forecasting in a manufacturing and distribution environment?"


#### Data Sources
The data for this analysis will be sourced from the M5 Forecasting Accuracy competition dataset, available on Kaggle: M5 Forecasting Accuracy Dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/data

#### Methodology
I plan to utilize machine learning techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), and gradient boosting models like XGBoost. Additionally, I will incorporate feature engineering, time series decomposition, and model evaluation techniques to compare the performance of these models in forecasting demand.

#### Results
If LSTM/XGBoost performed well: You can conclude that machine learning models are a powerful tool for improving demand forecasting accuracy, especially in scenarios where demand is influenced by many factors like seasonality, promotions, or external events.
Challenges faced: Issues such as zero predictions or scaling problems highlight that these models require careful tuning and data preprocessing. However, once properly configured, they provide significant advantages over traditional methods.
Overall Improvement: Assuming your models eventually provided accurate forecasts, you can argue that machine learning approaches (LSTM, XGBoost) provide a flexible and scalable solution for demand forecasting in the manufacturing and distribution sectors.
